# Circular Motion

This is one of the fewest README.md files I wrote without many things to say
because of being mesmerized by the beauty of Art.

Sincerely speaking, you got have to be in free time before deciding to watch
the beauty of circular motion I coded. Otherwise, this may disrupt your day. I can personally spend more than 10 minutes viewing the 
cool motions and how the mouse create thrilling effects.

I love coding; kindly do the same, too,

Hirwa.
